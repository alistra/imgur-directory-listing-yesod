h1. imgur-directory-listing-yesod

This is a directory listing app for people with slow upload speeds. Each image in the images directory is uploaded to "imgur.com":imgur.com and then each link on the site redirects users to "imgur.com":http://imgur.com.

h1. How does it work?

It's using hinotify in an another thread, to add and delete images from the database, each time a file is moved in/out, deleted or created in the images directory.

h2. Installation

In the folder:

bc. cabal install

Set the image directory (imgdir variable) in the HinotifyHandler.hs file.
